# Friday Night Funkin': Pie Engine

**Friday Night Funkin': Pie Engine** is a recreation of Friday Night Funkin' in Python, using the **Pygame-ce** library!

The name **Pie Engine** was derived from **py**, the extension for a Python file (.py). You normally pronounce it like pie. Hence, **Pie Engine**.


## Libraries used:
- Pygame-ce
- Pyinstaller
- psutil
- pgbitmapfont
- pytweening
- xmltodict
- Possibly a few others that I missed
